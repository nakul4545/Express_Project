// let studentArray = []    this method we use when we want store the data in studentData.txt file
    // studentArray.push(student)
    // console.log(student)
    // FileSystem.appendFile('studentData.txt' ,JSON.stringify(studentArray) ,  function(error){ //Objects cannot be inserting to file but array so we create array
    //     console.log(error)  //Two different application of diff. language cannot read each other code thats why we need JSON

    // })  //Whatever in this file will save in file but we cannot pass object directly to file

    the above all code for .txt file which is of no use we want to store data in JSON file

    All EJS FILES we have to store them in views for this is inbuilt rule
    <!-- <%= This is syntax for values in ejs %> -->
    <!-- <% This is for only control flows means loops and if-else%> -->
